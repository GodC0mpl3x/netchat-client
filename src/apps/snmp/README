lwIP SNMPv2c agent
==================

Based on SNMP stack written by Christiaan Simons <christiaan.simons@axon.tv>

Rewritten by Martin Hentschel <info@cl-soft.de> and
Dirk Ziegelmeier <dziegel@gmx.de>

Changes:
  - SNMPv2c support
  - Greatly reduced RAM usage, no memory pools any more
  - API cleanup
  - MIB2 is separated from SNMP stack
  - Support for multiple MIBs (snmp_set_mibs call) - e.g. for private MIB
  - Improved MIB2 implementation (tcpConnTable etc.)
  - Redesigned simple and generic API for MIB implementation
  - Comfortable node types for scalar arrays and tables
  - Counter64, bit and truthvalue datatype support
  - Callbacks for SNMP writes
  - Runs on two APIs: RAW and netconn
  - Async API is gone - the stack now supports netconn API instead,
    so blocking operations can be done in MIB calls.
    SNMP runs in a worker thread when netconn API is used.
  - Simplified thread sync support for MIBs - useful when MIBs
    need to access variables shared with other threads without locking
    (used in MIB2 to access lwIP stats from lwIP thread)

Currently in work:
  - Traps rewrite
  - MIB compiler
